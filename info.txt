Project info as follows:
Project uses MongoDB along with meteor to create collections (One created in api directory, users collections created from command line with meteor)
Styled with Sass (Files aren't compiled to css)
Logging into the site to make posts operates normally and posts are created with unique email/id values attached to them, this can be viewed in the console but could not get them to render in the client. 
Logout button is also situational, I suspect it has to do with how meteor makes use of localStore for collections or how react handles strings with unallowed characters(the @ symbol).
